Hello! I am a PhD researcher in Psychology at Stanford University. My work broadly focuses on something that nearly all of us have probably experienced at one point or another: concerns about being perceived as "smart" by others. In my research, I aim to explore why we form these concerns and how they might influence our behavior, particularly in achievement settings like the classroom or the workplace.

I am passionate about translating my findings into actionable insights, and I hope to further leverage my research skills to have real-world impact on users' experiences.
