Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Psychology at Stanford University, advised by Drs. [Ellen Markman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ellen-markman) and [Carol Dweck](https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck). My research broadly focuses on how our social context influences our motivation to achieve.

I am passionate about translating my findings into actionable insights, and I hope to further leverage my research skills to have real-world impact on users' experiences.
