title: "What beliefs drive parents to engage in 'helicopter' parenting practices?"
excerpt: "Even when well-intended, intrusive or 'helicopter' parenting practices, such as completing homework assignments for one's child instead of letting them do it themselves, can be damaging to kids' motivation. Why do parents engage in these practices? And what messages might these practices communicate to children about their abilities?<br/><br/><img src='/images/parenting_icon.png'>"

Parents play a critical role in fostering (or hindering) their children’s motivation to achieve. When parents intervene only when needed, children can thrive; when parents “helicopter,” or intervene excessively, children may persist less and become overly dependent.

In collaboration with my PhD advisors, Drs. Carol Dweck and Ellen Markman, I explored a belief that might drive these influential parenting practices: the belief that strong parental intervention is necessary for a child’s success.

In a pre-registered study, we probed these beliefs among parents of adolescents and found that the more parents endorsed the general belief that parents need to intervene to solve problems for even adult children, the more they later agreed with specific high-intervention practices targeted at adolescents’ achievement (e.g., doing a school project for one’s adolescent child).

Follow-up studies revealed that parents who held the strongest beliefs endorsed high-intervention practices regardless of whether the target adolescent was low- or high-achieving. These findings suggest that beliefs about the necessity of parental intervention may shape parents’ achievement-related practices.
