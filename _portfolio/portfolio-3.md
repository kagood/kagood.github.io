title: "Talk: How parents' and teacheres' help can send messages about children's abilities"
excerpt: "Decades of research have found that the explicit feedback (e.g., praise) that parents and teachers give to students can influence their beliefs about themselves as well as their motivation to learn. But what might parents' and teachers' *actions* - including the help they give - implicitly convey to students about their abilities?"
